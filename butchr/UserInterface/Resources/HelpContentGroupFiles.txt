All of your images are now imported from the source location. 
You now have to group them.
Grouping means that you select all source images that belong to one series of brackets and either:
- press the 'Group selected images' button on the toolbar (the one with the connected chains)
- select 'Group selected images' from the main menu.
- press 'S' 
A small yellow square with the group number will be added to each selected image.

If you grouped the wrong images, you can ungroup them by selecting them and perform one of these actions:
- press the 'Ungroup selected images' button on the toolbar (the one with the disconnected chains)
- select 'Ungroup selected images' from the main menu.
- press 'D' 
The small yellow square with the group number will disappear immediately and the selected images are 
no longer grouped.

The keyboard shortcuts do not have a deeper meaning - they are just easy to reach with my left hand.
They can not be changed to other keys up to now, but maybe it feel like coding a configuration dialog 
in one of the next versions of the butchr.

Instead of grouping the images manually, you can also try the autogroup feature to group the images 
by their original timestamp. The autogroup feature is accessible from the main menu or the toolbar,
just click the magic wand to make it happen.
