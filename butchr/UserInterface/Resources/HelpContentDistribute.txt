On distribution, the imported files will be transferred from the temporary target folder to their final destinations.
If any files were not grouped, they will remain in the temporary target folders (JpgInitial and RawInitial).
The directory structure after distribution will look as follows:

+-TargetFolder
|
+--001
|
+---jpg (containing the jpgs of the set)
|
+---raw (containing the raw files of the set)
|
+---work (initially empty, I use it to store any backups during further processing and the final images here)
|
+--002
|
+---jpg
|
+---raw
|
+---work
|
... (repeat this for all specified groups)
|
+--done (initially empty, I use this to store all final images in full resolution as jpgs)
|
+--internet (initially empty, I use this to store all final images in a flickr/fotocommunity resolution as jpgs)
|
+--tiff (initially empty, I use this to store all final images in full resolution as lossless tiff)
|
+--JpgInitial (containing all JPGs that were not grouped)
|
+--RawInitial (containing all RAWs that were not grouped)
