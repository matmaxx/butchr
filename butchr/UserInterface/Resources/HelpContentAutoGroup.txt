The autogroup feature will read the exif data of all imported files and will try to automatically find 
and group those images that form the single HDR brackets. To accomplish this, it uses the 'original timestamp'
field from the JPGs exif data.
Before the algorithm jumps though the imported images, you have to specify a maximum interval in the original timestamp 
that may pass between two single images to be considered to belong to the same series of brackets.
It usually works fine with a value of about 10 seconds, but if you e.g. had to wait for some people to pass a scene while 
taking one set of exposures, you might want to increase the interval.
The thumbnails are then tagged in the same way as they would be when they were grouped manually - indicated by a yellow
square with their group number.

After the butchr has finished the autogrouping, you can change the autogenerated groups as described in the help screen 
for manual grouping.
In case the autogrouping produced nothing but trash, there is an 'Ungroup all images' button. In this case, you have to go 
manually through the images (and think about the spped you are taking brackets next time).

Also, if you experience any problems with images taken with something else than a Nikon camera, please let me know by 
filling out the bug report on http://www.butcher.net/support
