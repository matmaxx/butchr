1.0
First official version
1.1
Added exif viewer
Refined debug/output messages
LogManager now stores the LogType in the eventargs - used to display LogEvents in different colors
removed xptable dummy row handling
Reset imagemanager and clear listview after distribution to avoid images beeing grouped several times
Bugfix: No more Offset calculation required on distribution
Bugfix: Fixed some contextual issues on the helpfiles
Bugfix: Removing all groups of a second import on a directory that already contained imagedirectories has set the initial group id to 001 instead of max(existing).
1.2.
On import, the butchr now ask to create non existing target directories automatically. But this only works if the parent directory already exists.
Bugfix: Thumbnail creation progress was only visible on debug builds
Bugfix: When importing multiple cards, the calculation on the new indices and offsets was correct while grouping the images, but was wrong during distribution
Bugfix: Scratch batch files were created using standard UTF encoding. Therefore paths with german mutated vowels did not work while executing the batchfile.
